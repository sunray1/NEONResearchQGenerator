*****

This app generates random research questions that could be answered using data available on NEON. This is designed to be used as a jumping off point to generate ideas. Try restructuring and expanding your questions in chatGPT to further dig into them.

Note that not all research questions will make ecological/biological 'sense' necessarily.

Remember that correlation does not equal causation when thinking about your research question. Being able to predict something based on something else is asking if they are correlated, where causation seeks to define the cause of something happening - the how or why. (ex. shoe size and intellegence are correlated, but ultimately, age is the causual variable)

At its simplest, establishing causation requires:

1. Correlation
2. Ruling out of confounding variables - can typically be done by randomizing all other variables (try analyzing the relationship at other sites)
3. A plausible theory of why X causes Y
